# The Little Hiker - A Time-Based Pixel Art Scene

A dynamic pixel-art animation built with HTML Canvas that changes its theme based on the user's local time. Experience a serene rainy hike during the day (6 AM - 6 PM) and a tranquil campfire scene at night.

This project was a fun exercise in creative coding, animation, and creating an immersive atmosphere with minimal tools.
